# SQL Fundamentals

The following courses are a part of the SQL Fundamental Track that are available in this repository.
## 1) Intro to SQL for Data Science
Overview-Master the basics of querying tables in relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
### Course Description
The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called relational databases. To be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL . This course teaches syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with databases today!
### Topics Covered-
### 1.1 Selecting Columns
### 1.2 Filtering Rows
### 1.3 Aggregate Functions
### 1.4 Sorting and Grouping

## 2) Joining Data in SQL
Join two or three tables together into one, combine tables using set theory, and work with subqueries in PostgreSQL.
### Course Description
Now that you've learned the basics of SQL in our Intro to SQL for Data Science course, it's time to supercharge your queries using joins and relational set theory. In this course, you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self joins, semi joins, anti joins and cross joins—fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. Never fear set theory again after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries. You will be able to visually grasp these ideas by using Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations.
### Topics Covered-
### 2.1 Introduction to joins
### 2.2 Outer joins and cross joins
### 2.3 Set theory clauses
### 2.4 Subqueries

## 3) Intermediate SQL
Master the complex SQL queries necessary to answer a wide variety of data science questions and prepare robust data sets.
## 4) SQL for Exploratory Data Analysis
Learn how to explore what's available in a database: the tables, relationships between them, and data stored in them.
